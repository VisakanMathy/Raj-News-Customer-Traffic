# Raj New Customer Traffic

Raj news is a local convenience store situated in Lambeth ran by a family business. They have provided a high quality tailored service for the community for the past 20 years and hope to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.

The store specialises in providing quality customer service and giving the customers what they need. This includes a series of services such as oyster and electricity top up aswell as personalised groceries and drinks that are favoured by the community. It is this unique adaptability that has allowed them to thrive

Raj New's is now looking to further understand the workings of the customers from a technological point of view and more specifically how the outside world affects them
